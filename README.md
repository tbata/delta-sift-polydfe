# delta-sift-polydfe

Welcome to the `delta-sift-polydfe` repository.  

We document here the analysis of data made for 

**J Chen, T Bataillon, S Gl√©min, M Lascoux**, Hunting for beneficial mutations: conditioning on SIFT scores when estimating the distribution of fitness effect of new mutations, Genome Biology and Evolution, 2021; evab151, https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evab151

Summary of [polyDFE][] outputs that we analyze are stored in` /data`.  

`.Rmd` files for carrying the analysis are under `/analysis` and the scripts numbered sequentially.  

The output of these .Rmd files are under `/docs`.  



NB This is a [workflowr][] project.
